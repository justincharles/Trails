Garver has served as an NASA employee, and an advisor to corporations and politicians, but she has never been faced with such a monumental task—forging a new direction for American space policy.

So when Lars-Erik De Geer, a researcher with the Swedish Defense Research Agency, published a paper early this year claiming evidence of low-yield nuclear detonations in 2010, it seemed feasible. His evidence is a spike in radionuclides—isotopes of xenon and argon that are produced by a nuclear weapon—picked up by detectors in Asia. There was one problem with the theory: Nuclear detonations shake seismic monitors, and scientists at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory who looked at his paper found no evidence of a sufficiently large explosion, throwing the existence of a clandestine test in doubt. We talked to Paul Richards of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, who co-authored the paper questioning De Geer’s conclusions.
